            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome! I am Xinyi Cui, often known by friends as Anny. I am on a journey to explore the fascinating intersection of quantitative analysis and economic theory. My academic pursuits are driven by a deep interest in subjects like Analytic Geometry, Multivariate Calculus, and Game Theory.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics and professional engagements, I am deeply involved in several projects and extracurricular activities. My undergraduate senior thesis focuses on the intriguing impact of Otaku culture on the popularity of mobile RPGs, blending my love for gaming with academic research. ECON Thesis at University of Puget Sound: <a href = "https://NianAnny.github.io/Anny%20Thesis.pdf" target = "_blank">  Otaku Culture's Impact on the Mobile Role-Playing Game (RPG) Popularity: An Analytical Exploration of Trends and Influences in the Modern Digital Age</a> </p>
            
            <p>In my leisure time, you can find me immersed in a good book, listening music, playing chess, enjoying morning jogging with sunrise, or volunteering in community services. These activities not only enrich my life but also keep me grounded and connected to my community.</p>
            <p>As I continue my educational journey and gear up for a future in data analysis, I am excited about the opportunities to integrate my analytical skills, economic understanding, and passion for technology to make a meaningful impact.</p>
